**Counting Public Roadspace in Gurgaon, India**
Carlyle Davis


Upon a [recent article in CityLabs](http://bit.ly/1VxNBSD) about the privitization of public services in
the city of Gurgaon, India, I set out to quickly calculate the percentage of land
devoted to "public" roads that companies will have to upkeep.  This is especially
relevant as the city's administration attempts to find a sponsor to build and maintain
a new light rail system featuring "driverless taxi pods" that will serve the city's
population, and alleviate the traffic burden of the 876,000+ inhabitants.

After obtaining road maps of the city from Google Maps, I converted the images into
black/white images, and counted the number of black pixels (roads / highways) vs.
the total pixels in each image to obtain a rough percentage of public space devoted to roads.

**I calculate that ~8% of the land in Gurgaon India is devoted to roads and highways**

One way this project could be improved is to include parks, plazas, and other large
gathering space for the city, in order to have a rough approximate for total public space.

For code and/or to reproduce my results, please see the Ipython Notebook in this
folder, and the included image files.
