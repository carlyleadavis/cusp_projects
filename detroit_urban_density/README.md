**Analysis of Detroit’s Density Distribution**

Carlyle Davis


The following analysis was done is Stata for academic collaboration purposes.  
Following the in class discussion to try to find another American metro area
with a similar urban density distribution as Detroit, I attempted to model
Detroit against cities with population of 1-2.5 million people.  I did not find
any striking similarities between the average distribution, though there were
some cities who followed Detroit’s distribution reasonably well.  There are very
few similarities between the final cities that have the same shaped distribution
as Detroit, save for Cleveland and Buffalo who both used to be industrial centers.

The do file can be found on my GitHub (it automatically downloads data from a
static link, and generates these graphs).  I have also linked an iPython notebook
that I used to regenerate the graphs in order to ‘bold’ the Detroit distribution
and make the similarities easier to see.
